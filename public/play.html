                    Magi: Oh sweet, silly, dumb dumb traveler. Your pet has been kidnapped! You have to be a great fighter, wise and crafty
                    in order to get your companion back. <br><br>
                    
                    Wizard: I have no fear! <br>
                    Warrior: I have no fear. <br>
                    Princess: I have no fear. <br>
                    Joker: I'm a little scared. <br><br>
                    
                    Magi: Well aren't you brave. Well you'll be challenged, but you have enough strength of spirit, integrity
                    and hubris to get through the challenges. <br><br>
                    First you will wander through great wilderness in this armor to get to the Potion Master. You will use your skills of craft and magic to make the ultimate clever potion. <br>
                    Once you've created your ultimate clever potion, you travel to through the swamp to the great bridge. There is the genius troll. The only way he will let you pass is if you
                    beat him fair and square in trivia. Challenge him to a game, his pride will fail him every time. <br>
                    The better you do at the Potion Master Challenage the stronger your potion and the more hints you can get in the Web Development Test for Your Life. If you are smart enough to pass the bridge you will be in the Kingdom on Naanjibar. I have no idea what he's doing to your sweet pet, but you
                    better hurry. The wizard is known to be pure evil, your pet is surely in danger. <br><br>
                    
                    Collect the coins through each journey to gain strength and health points - You may need them, it is going to be a dangerous journey. Collect the key to unlock the door to the next challenge.</div>
